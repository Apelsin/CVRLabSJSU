Chemistry VR lab

## Introduction

This VR project allows users to view molecular motion within a confined space, tensile testing, interactive experiments, and allow users to grab molecules to hold.

## Code Samples

To open up the Environment clone the repo go to Assets --> TheLab and open up that Unity scene. Make sure to use the correct Unity Game Engine when running the project. I can't remember off the top of my head, which engine it was, but it should say. 

The object' code is within the Assets --> Scripts --> new Scripts folder for all the button press, atom spawning, teleportation, and pretty much anything within this project. Button Pressed scripts are attached to the button objects, and allow any type of molecule 3d model/object/prefab to be attached to it.

Molecules are within the Assets --> Prefabs --> Molecules folder. These molecules have either box colliders or each molecule has a spherical collider or cylindrical collider around its individual structure.



## Installation

1. Download the Zip (This will take about a minute, the file size is large due to some unnecessary assets within the project that need to be cleaned out).
2. Extract the Folder.


1. Download Unity 5.5.2f https://broguesquadron.slack.com/archives/C5UH117D1/p1516764755000072
2. Open up "The Lab" 
3. Make sure the HTC Vive Steam VR is setup
4. Click Play to Run Simulation.
